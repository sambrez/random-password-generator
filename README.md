## Description

This project contains refactored code, both HTML and CSS, for Horiseon's website. HTML and CSS code were both refactored to address accessibility concerns expressed by the client to the developer. Use of semantic HTML, clear structure and organization of elements, and the addition of alt attributes help to update the code so that it more closely follows industry accessiblity standards. These improvements also help to enhance the site for search engines. In the future, accessibility standards should be considered and followed in the initial stages of writing codebase.
