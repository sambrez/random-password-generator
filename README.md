# random-password-generator

## Description

This repository contains code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website that randomly generates passwords for users. It includes prompts for the user to select what character types they would like included (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols) as well as their desired password length. Variables, functions, conditional statements, for loops, and event listners were all utilized in JavaScript to create a dynamic webpage that is capable of generating a random password based on user assigned criteria. I found the for lopp used to generate the password to be the most challenging part of this project and look forward to having more opportunities to practice this specific skill. I found that I had a greater understanding of variables and conditional statements and this project let me showcase that.

I would like to acknowledge the help I received from both Alex, an AskBSC learning assistant, as well as Michell Brito of the BootCamp Tutor Team who both gave me guidance in resolving challenges and issues that I faced while developing this repository. They both were able to help me find and address mistakes as well as provide me with starting points for addressing specific sections of code block.
